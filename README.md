# AI Programming with Python Project

## Motivations

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

## Dataset

This is a [dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html), consisting of 102 flower categories. The flowers chosen to be flower commonly occuring in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of between 40 and 258 images. The details of the categories and the number of images for each class can be found on this [category statistics page](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/categories.html).
